# CFM 101 Final Project

This is our CFM 101 final project, created by Max, Rain, and Sean. Our goal was to match the S&P 500 and TSX 60, known for being great investments, given any random list of stocks. The full details of the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wmXcQdR3-AxvA7cz-oPQO1AXmX4WRLVc/view).

In our algorithm, we take into account volume, volatility, sector correlation, and index distribution by sector in order to quantify how "good" a stock is. Furthermore, we implemented a weighted maximum bipartitie matching algorithm in order to ensure we obtained the best possible portfolio we could feasibly create.
