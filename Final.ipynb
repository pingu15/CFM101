    "#### Intial strategy:\n",
    "In terms of overall strategy, we sought to replicate the market, matching the S&P 500 and TSX 60 sector composition. The simulated portfolio remains diversified by weighting stocks according to the sector’s actual market representation. For each sector, the algorithm identifies the stocks that have the highest correlation with the sector’s performance, selecting those stocks that move most similarly to the industry as they represent its behavior best. Once these stocks are identified, the strategy allocates more weight to the stocks that are most correlated with the sector, with the number of stocks selected based on the sector’s weight in the index. Specifically, for each industry, the top N stocks are chosen, where N is calculated as a percentage of the sector’s weight in the index, multiplied by 25. Additionally, the allocation progressively decreases for each subsequent stock in the industry. The strategy aims to backtest this portfolio construction to simulate potential profits by using historical data, allowing it to assess whether this sector-based selection method can outperform broader market indices. Essentially, the strategy seeks to leverage sector-specific performance to build a portfolio that could potentially beat the market.\n",

    "## Design decisions \n",
    "1. We discovererd that for one particular stock, it can have a a high corrlation to mutiple sectors of the S&P. We have decided to put a maximium cap.\n",

    "#### Performance & Correlation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, is the core of our algorithm. We decided to select stocks by their correlation to different sectors. First, we will be determining the correlation/ beta between the sectors and individual stock. From there, we will be selecting the stocks that have the most correlation with a specific sectors. In theory, a stock from technology can be selected to repersent the performance for other sectors other than tech. However, this is unlikely to happen, since the sectors indices only contains the stock of that specific sector. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have implemented functions to compute beta and correlation of each stock with each index. Throught testing, we decided to go with [insert method], as it does out-perform [insert other method]. This method provides a more direct measure of how closely the stock movements align with the sector's performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start constructing the portfolio by calculating the correlation and beta for each stock relative to the sectors. These calculations identifies the stocks that will most accurately represent their respective sectors in the portfolio. Our goal is to maintain a balance between sectors while minimizing risk through diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we apply the max percentage rule to ensure that no single stock makes up more than 15% of the portfolio. Optimizing through binary search ensures we can find the optimal stock allocation, allowing us to include 24 stocks in the final portfolio while maintaining the diversification constraints. The create_portfolio function then selects stocks with the highest correlation to each sector, assigning each stock a weight based on the calculated correlations and the portfolio’s allocation rules. This maximum weight matching approach allows us to match stocks to sectors based on their correlation strength, making sure that stocks most aligned with a given sector are selected. This minimizes risk and diversifies the portfolio. \n"
